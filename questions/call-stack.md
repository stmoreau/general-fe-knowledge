# What is the call stack?

_In computer science, a **call stack** is a \***\*stack\*\*** data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of **stack** is also known as an execution **stack**, program **stack**, control **stack**, run-time **stack**, or machine **stack**, and is often shortened to just "the **stack**"._
